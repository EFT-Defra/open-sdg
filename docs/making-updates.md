<h1>Making updates to data and metadata</h1>

Below we describe what is required before you can start making updates to your Open SDG platform

## Before you start

These steps have four pre-requisites:

1. An internet connection
2. A web browser
3. A [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account

    If you do not already have one, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) now to sign up for your free account.
4. A working implementation of Open SDG (hereafter referred to as the "staging site")

    In most cases, the "staging site" will be something similar to: `https://my-org.github.io/my-site` (but with `my-org` and `my-site` changed as appropriate). If you do not have such a site available, or you are not sure, check with your team before continuing. Instructions on getting started are available on the [Quick Start page](quick-start.md).

## GitHub.com login

For all of the steps, you will need to be logged into GitHub.com, in whatever web browser you are using. To check just visit [GitHub.com](https://github.com). If you are not already logged in, click "Sign in" to log in.

NOTE: As long as you continue using the same web browser that you used to log in, the following steps will work. If you switch browsers, or clear your browser cache, you will need to log into GitHub.com again before continuing.


Now that you're ready to start making updates, see the subsections of this guidance.
