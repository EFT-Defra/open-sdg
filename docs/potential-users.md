<h1>Potential users</h1>

If you are considering using an Open SDG platform, we would love to hear about it. Please email the Open SDG team at [mailto:opensdg@googlegroups.com](opensdg@googlegroups.com) or [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/issues/new) to let us know and ask us questions.

## Considerations

Some things to consider when thinking about setting up an Open SDG platform are:

**1. How much data and metadata has been collected?**
Setting up an Open SDG platform is quite straightforward and doesn't take much time. However, collecting data and metadata for each of the indicators is more difficult and can be very time consuming, and it is just as important to report metadata as it is data.

We recommend that data should not be uploaded for an indicator until the metadata is also ready to be uploaded.

**2. What format will data and metadata be inputted in?**
Data can be input in:

- CSV (default)
- SDMX (SDMX-ML and SDMX-JSON - either through uploading files or by connecting to SDMX-API endpoint)
- CKAN

Metadata can be input in:

- YAML (default)
- CSV
- Excel

**3. What technical abilities and resources do you have available?**
Knowing what technical abilities and resources you have available will allow you to enlist any help you may require early on.

**4. What language do you want your Open SDG platform to be available in?**
Open SDG platforms can be set up in a single language or in multiple languages.

Translations are readily available in the six official languages of the UN:

- Arabic
- Chinese
- English
- French
- Russian
- Spanish

Translations can also be added for other languages if you wanted your Open SDG platform in a different language.

**5. Will you be reporting national indicators as well as global indicators?**
It is possible to report national indicators alongside global indicators straight out of the box. See [Kyrgyzstan's Open SDG platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/2/) for an example.

However, some countries, such as Germany, have chosen to set up a separate platform to report their national indicators and have linked their global and national platform together. See [Germany's Open SDG platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en/2/).

Knowing if and how you want to report national indicators from the start will make the process more efficient.

**6. Do you have any deadlines e.g. VNR for getting Open SDG platform live?**
